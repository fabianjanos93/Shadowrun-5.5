### Actions [Page 49]

Actions have been rebranded as Major, Minor and Free Actions.

### Attributes [Page 51]

Strength has absorbed Body as an attribute.
This applies to each and every aspect that was governed by these attributes,
including:

- Condition Monitors
- Skills
- Damage Resist
- etc.

When considering attribute maximums, and starting scores, always calculate with Strength.
When something would increase your Strenght or Body, you can apply it to your Strength.
If something were to increase both attributes, use the Strength value.

In Chummer, after moving to Career mode, apply to new Body Value as a special modification.

### Edge Use [Page 56]

The additional dice you roll from Blitz also count in the action economy.

### Priority Table [Page 65]

Metatypes that have 0 special attribute points in the table increase their available
special attributes to 1.

Aspected Magicians at Priority C also get 7 spells and increase their Magic to 4 instead of 3.
Aspected Magicians at Priority B get 10 spells.

Resources at Priority A are increased by an additional 5000 nuyen to 455,000 nuyen.

Skill tables have been massively changed to favour Skill Groups more heavily.

(Supported by Custom Chummer Zip)

### Aspected Magicians [Page 69]

Aspected magicians choose a spell category instead:

- Combat
- Detection
- Health
- Manipulation
- Illusion

They may only learn spells of the given type and they can only summon spirits that match that spell's type in
their tradition. They may learn Sorcery, Enchanting and Conjuring skills as a regular mage would.

### Positive Qualities [Page 71]

Aptitude's Karma cost is decreased to 7 from 14

### Negative Qualities [Page 84]

National SIN is now 10 Karma up from 5. National SINs grant you the advantage of having a full fledged SIN on with the
downside of any authority with access to the Global SIN Registry having an easier time finding you. Whenever you do
something that causes your Notoriety to increase, the GM can roll an amount of D6 equal to your Notoriety. If they score
5 hits, the system matched managed to narrow down that you have taken part in illegal activities, making you into a
wanted criminal. All your assets linked to your SIN are frozen, and law enforcement is dispatched to the residence
marked on your official SIN. Your Notoriety also increases by 1 when this happens, and your SIN becomes a Criminal SIN.

Criminal SIN is now 20 Karma, up from 10. You start the game with 1 Notoriety. Whenever your Notoriety increases, the
GM might roll an amount of D6 equal to your Notoriety. If they score more than 4 hits, your Notoriety increases by 1.

Corporate Limited SIN and Corporate SIN is now merged together into Coporate Affiliated SIN. This quality costs 0 Karma.
This grants you the benefits of a National SIN except the GM will have to score 6 hits instead of 5. Corporations tend
to protect their own. However, if you caused harm to the Corporation that issued your SIN in any way, and that caused
your Notoriety to go up, the System only has to score 3 hits, at which point your SIN is either flagged as Criminal,
downgraded to National, or burned, depending on the kind of damage you did.

### Final Calculations [Page 101]

Physical Limit is (Strength x2 + Agility + Reaction) / 3

### Character Advancement [Page 103]

The time it takes to improve your Attributes and Skills are overruled by the Offtime System. Attributes take four
Offtime Action to increase beyond their Karma Cost from 0 to 4, eight from 5 to 8 and twelve from 8 to 12. Skills take
two, four, and eight in their respective skill point range.

### Buying Qualities after Chargen [Page 106]

Negative Qualities can be purchased off for just their Karma Value and Positive Qualities can be bought with their Karma
value instead of twice their Karma cost.

### Combat Active Skills [Page 130]

### Combat [Page 158]

This is the big one.

#### Initiative and Action Economy

Initiative is still determined by Reaction + Intuition + Initiatie Dice, but this simply determines the order
in which characters or groups of characters act. You only roll initiative once at the start of combat.

On each turn, players receive one Major Action, one Free Action, and an amount of Minor Actions equal to the character's
initiative dice plus one. So for example:

Magma has Reaction 5, Intuition 3 and 2 initiative dice from a Rating 1 Wired Reflexes. He gets 1 Major, 1 Free, and
3 Minor Actions.

You can exchange 3 Minor Actions for a Major Action.
You can always exchange a Minor or Major action for a Free action, and you can always exchange a Major action for a
Minor action.

Whenever you'd get more initiative dice, you immediately get the Minor Actions from it too.

You can choose to delay your turn. After any character has finished their turn that is after yours in the initiative
order, you can decide to have your delayed turn.

#### Movement

Your base walking speed is REA + AGI per turn. You can spend a Minor Action to run instead of walk, causing your
movement speed to double. Running causes no penalty to your actions, but also no advantage on meele attacks.

If you want to go full speed you can spend a Major action instead to break into a full Sprint.
You get to make an Athletics + STR test and add twice the number of hits scored as additional meters in addition to the
doubled movement speed.

Movement does not cost a free action.

If exact distances are hard to keep track of while you play, you can have all characters move roughly the same distance,
and have running and sprinting double or triple it respectively.

#### Action Mapping

For most of the possible Actions in the Core Rulebook, you can use the mapping of:
Complex Action -> Major Action
Simple Action -> Minor Action

The following are the exceptions:
Running -> Minor Action
Reckless Spellcasting -> Removed
Command Spirit -> Removed
Fire Bow -> Major Action
Fire Weapon -> Major Action
Rigger Jump In -> Minor Action
Astral Projection -> Minor Action
Block -> Minor Action

Interrupt Actions costing -5 now cost a Minor Action, those costing -10 cost a Major action.
Interrupt Actions have to be declared before rolling for the defense test. You cannot see how many hits you could score
without them and then decide to roll the additional ones.

#### Action Changes

Take Aim confers image magnification or scope bonuses, but either has to be used to reset recoil, or add +1 accuracy
and +1 dice. The limit on how many times you can take this action is still half the character's Willpower rounded up,
but the bonuses are lost at the beginning of the characters next turn.

Block and Parry add the net hit scored by the defender, if any, to their next meele attack against the attacking
character. They can also be used against ranged attacks if they are in meele range.

Dodge enables you to move a number of meters equal to your net hits, if any, at it also works against ranged attacks.

Intercept allows you to attack the target trying to leave your meele range without costing an additional action.

#### Elemental Damage

Acid damage reduces Armor all at once by net hits scored on the attack roll. This is immediately applied on the Damage
soak roll.

Cold Damage applies a negative dice modifier to the next Physical Action (Linked to Phys. Attribute) of the target.

Electricity Damage can be Stun instead of Physical at the caster's discretion. A character that has taken electricity
damage will have 1 less minor action on their next turn. This does not accumulate with multiple hits. Electricity
damage will also deal 2 damage per net hit to drones and other electrical devices instead of 1 per net hit.

Fire damage deals 2 damage per net hit to biological targets instead of 1 per net hit.

#### Defense

Characters defend against attacks with only Reaction by default instead of Reaction + Intuition.

#### Damage and Multiple Attack

In Shadowpunk, groups of enemies often act and suffer together as a single unit. Normally, an attack against a unit
would only affect a single member of it, any additional damage that would have been dealt to it after it is eliminated 
no longer matters.

This changes when a character uses the Multiple Attack free action, or uses an Area of Effect attack. When this action
is used, your excess damage is dealt to the next member of the unit, then the next if that enemy was also downed.
The limit of how many enemies your damage can overflow to is equal to the number of additional enemies you could target 
according to the original rules.
Attacks that can make use of the Multiple Attack action are:

- Shotguns with appropriate choke settingsv (Overflow limit set defined by choke settings)
- Dual Wielded weapons (Doubles the overflow limit of the firing mode)
- Meele Attacks (Overflow limit equal to the amount of targets in meele range)
- Weapons firing multiple bullets (Overflow limit equal to the bullets fired)
- Projectile weapons that have readied multiple projectiles. (Overflow limit equal to the amount of projectiles readied)

#### Ranged Combat

Environmental Modifiers act as a second threshold on the defense test instead of negative modifiers. That means that the
attacker has to score more at least as many hits than the environmental threshold, and more hits than the defender.

Environmental modifiers are changed in the following ways:

| Modifier  | Threshold |
|-----------|-----------|
| 0         | 0         |
| -1        | 1         |
| -3        | 2         |
| -6        | 3         |

Environmental modifiers are cumulative. This means that even on an unaware target who gets no defence test, sniping him
on a dark knight (2) with heavy rain (3) and from an extreme distance (3) with light wind (1) you'd need to score 9
hits to hit.

Environmental Thresholds do not affect net hits scored, that always counts against the defender's hits.

Recoil resets at the beginning of each character's turn.

Suppressive fire is defended against by Reaction only.

Dual wielding allows you to fire the guns you are holding in the same action if they are the same type and have the 
same firing mode set. This means double the amount of bullets you shoot, but also double the recoil penalty!

Grenades are now a simple opposed test when attacking. Roll Throwing Weapons + AGI vs Reaction. Environmental Thresholds
also apply, and if they are not met, the grenade scatters harmlessly somewhere else. Cover does not count against 
grenades. If the defender is successful they automatically move outside of the attack's range. If the defender is not
successful, the damage gets taken by a single target and automatically overflows. All grenade damage that decreases by
the number of meters away from the blast zone is reduced by 4 to account for the damage getting spread out evenly, but
net hits do cause more damage. Timer based grenades also grant a +4 modifier to the defender.

Sensor Attacks and Sensor Targeting are removed from the game.

#### Called Shots

Shake Up causes the defender to lose a Minor Action.

#### Cover and Barriers

Taking Cover now adds 3 auto hits to your Defense test no matter the cover you are in. This is under the assumption that
no matter the size of the cover, you manage to hide your full body behind it and only periodically peek outside. You can
always ask if there is any suitable cover around, or if a specific object could function as cover.

If the attacker has more hits than the hits you got from rolling dice, they hit the cover you are standing behind. 
From then on, apply the standard rules for when a projectile hits a barrier, except the GM may grant the Barrier
additional armor depending on how thick it is.

Any effect from your gun that would decrease the dice rolled for defense test such as shotgun spreads or full auto does
not reduce the auto hits from the cover.

#### Meele Combat

Attacking an opponent in meele range with a ranged weapon has a -2 penalty with a pistol, -4 with an SMG, -6 with
anything larger.

#### Unit Combat

Opposition in Shadowrun is usually not a single opponent, but a group of enemies, be it guards, paracritters, or drones.
In order to simplify combat against a mass number of enemies, this system uses the Unit Combat rules.

When Unit Combat is in effect, the enemies are grouped together into units. They retain their original statistics except
for their Condition Monitor, which is modified to be a fraction of the original CM (Expect roughly to match Professional
Rating, but don't take that as guaranteed).

Instead of rolling initiative for all members of the unit individually, roll once to determine their position in the
initiative order. When they take an action, all members of that unit take that same action, and use the same roll to 
resolve that action, but they do not have to perform that action the same way as the other members.

This is most prevalent when moving, taking cover, or attacking. Members don't have to move to the same position when
moving, don't have to move into the same cover, or shoot the same target.

If a member of the unit is unable to perform that specific action, for example, if the rest of his squad fires with 
Long Arms skill, but he doesn't have a weapon that uses that skill, the action is lost.

If a unit rolls for an action and members would have different modifiers based on their status effects and their
position, the majority rule applies. For example, if two members are shooting from Medium Range, but one is from Short 
range, the roll uses the Medium Range environmental threshold. If there is no clear majority, the GM makes the final call.

Units have to stay in unit coherency. This means that they cannot move to position themselves in a way where any member
would not have another member of the unit within 10 meters. If unit coherency is broken for any reason, the unit must
move to reestablish coherency, within reasonable limits.

Units cannot attack an opponent in meele range, because of how they might hit their allies. Conversely, other units will
also not shoot at the enemy attacking a friendly unit.

When a Unit declares an attack, all members must declare which enemy they are targeting. If multiple members are 
targeting the same opponent, then find the targeted opponent who has the lowest amount of members targeting them.
Add +1 dice to the attack roll for each member targeting that opponent, beyond the first.

To provide an example, a HTR team counting 7 members is up against two Shadowrunners. 4 are targeting runner A and 
3 are targeting runner B. All of them have the same weapons and statistics, resulting in a roll of 14, and they get
to add + 2 dice to that dice pool, because there is at least 3 members targeting each enemy they are shooting at.
They could have decided to target the same runner, all seven of them, which would have resulted in 14 + 6 dice.

Each player defends individually against Unit Attacks. Players who failed their defense test take the full damage of
the attack, plus net hits scored against their defense test, against soaking that individually.

When targeting a unit, the attacker must target individual members of the unit. If they are using the Multiple Attack
option, they have to designate the targets before making the attack roll. The environmental thresholds, modifiers, and
defense bonuses are calculated using majority rule. 

For example, if a player fires a full auto (10 bullets) on 3 opponents, and spreading the bullets with a 3/3/4 spread,
and two of them are in cover. The unit gets to defend with the three net hits from the cover bonus + Reaction, -2 dice
penalty for the additional bullets that are coming their way. 

If there is no majority, the GM makes the final call.

Some attacks against units can cause overflow. When a member of the unit goes down and the remaining damage would over
flow, the rest of the unit does not get to make an additional Damage Resistance Test, they take the full remaining
damage as long as there are eligible targets left.
